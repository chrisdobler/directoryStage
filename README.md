# Directory Stage

Directory stage is a cli environment which stages a set of virtual folders based on the
inputs you give it.

To star the cli:

```
  yarn && yarn start
```

# Try it out

To get an idea of what kind of operations you can perform, try running the specs:

```
  yarn spec/cli
```

The specs are organized in batches in the sample commands folder
