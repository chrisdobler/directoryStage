# Directory Stage

Directory stage is a cli environment which stages a set of virtual folders based on the
inputs you give it.

To start the cli:

```
  yarn && yarn start
```

To run the available case tests:

```
  yarn spec
```

# Try out some sample data

To try out the requested test cases start up the interface with a seed script.

```
yarn start --script=sample.db
```

But wait, the fun doesn't have to end there. When the script is finished you will be left with a command prompt where you can test additional cases.
